# 🧠 Django Journey — Learning Projects with Mohirdev

Hi there! 👋  
I'm a passionate **junior backend developer** currently learning Django through [Mohirdev](https://mohirdev.uz) tutorials.  
This repository serves as a personal archive of my learning journey, code experiments, and future project ideas.

> 🚧 Projects coming soon — I'm still exploring, building, and breaking things to learn better!
